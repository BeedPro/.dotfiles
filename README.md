# Dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files I use on my Debian system. My workflow is keyboard-driven and focusses on being as simple as possible, resulting in my environment to feel performant. I use the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) flavour of Debian for the base when installing the distro but typically use [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) on the day-to-day.
